          <div class="content">Sybella was purchased to serve as a companion doll for Artor Belmont, a traveling healer. Sybella and Artor spent years together traveling Adrellia, exploring nature and cultures for inventions and advancements for medical supplies and treatments. After years, Artor’s parents called him back to Flutone to inherit the family mansion as they wanted to spend time with their son before they kicked the bucket and wanted to see him settle down, get married and all that jazz while they were still there to see it. Artor was a little upset because he enjoyed the nomadic style that he had, and did not want to part ways with Sybella as they had grown close through their adventures. but he figured he could open a practice in town with Sybella acting as a nurse. </div>
