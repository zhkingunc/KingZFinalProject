          <div class="content">Despite the scary domains, Euctyl himself has a more nuanced personality. While he is undeniably an evil god, he is also staunchly against harm coming to his people, including Panouna's followers. In his viewpoint, a worshipper of Panouna also inherently reveres him, simply because he is her equal opposite. This is actually true, and they both draw a bit of power from the others worship. This unusual mercy doesn't extend to those who have turned their backs on the Peurie pantheon however, especially the Gereisst. Additionally, while being diametrically opposed, Euctyl doesn't oppose Panouna on a personal level either. In fact, he's in love with her. Whether this is genuine love or just misplaced longing for the before times is questionable though.</div>

          <div class="content">Euctyl is the neutral evil god of misfortune, misery, loss, death, and oppression. His domains are blood, death, night, tempest, and war. His avatar usually takes the form of a medium-skinned man with short, jagged black hair, yellow eyes, and piranha teeth. His form in his realm is much less human looking: featuring horns, eyes, and teeth in places they shouldn't be. His sacred animal is the crow. </div>
