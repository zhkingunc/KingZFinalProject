          <div class="content">Fillip never really knew his father, he left when he was far too young to remember anything. His mother was a sweet woman who was burnt out, lonely, and struggled to fill the hole that Fillips father left when he left her. Fillip didn’t hate his dad, in fact he believed his dad to be dead. Its easier to think his dad died than to think he would leave his mother the way he did.  </div>

          <div class="content">Fillip's dad, Otyx, is the Empyrean son of Euctyl, the Peurie god of oppression and misery. Otyx was born shortly after the collapse of the Peurie pantheon, by way of one of Euctyl's servants. He lived with his father in Hades for many years, only occasionally leaving to do his father's bidding in the mortal realm. On one such trip, he encountered Caragh, a Peurie woman living in Taraias. She was naïve and charming, and Otyx fell for her. Unfortunately, Caragh was a "non-believer AKA worshipped the Faerunian pantheon. As such, Euctyl did not approve of the relationship, and banished Otyx.  </div>
